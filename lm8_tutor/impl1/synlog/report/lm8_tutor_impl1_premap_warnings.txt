@W: BN132 :"d:\github\lattice\lm8_tutor\platform1\soc\../soc\../components/uart_core/rtl/verilog\txmitt.v":528:6:528:11|Removing sequential instance platform1_u.uart.u_txmitt.genblk5.thr_ready because it is equivalent to instance platform1_u.uart.u_txmitt.genblk4.thr_empty. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"d:\github\lattice\lm8_tutor\platform1\soc\../soc\platform1.v":246:0:246:5|Found inferred clock platform1_top|clk_in_inferred_clock which controls 283 sequential elements including platform1_u.arbiter.locked. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
