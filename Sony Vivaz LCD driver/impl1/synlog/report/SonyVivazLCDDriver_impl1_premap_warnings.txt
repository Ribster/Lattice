@W: MT531 :"z:\github\lattice\sony vivaz lcd driver\lcd_sender.vhd":73:2:73:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 3 sequential elements including inst_lcd_sender.lcd_write.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
