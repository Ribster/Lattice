GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'synch_rst_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global

        not.
        

     Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will
     not respond to the reset signal 'synch_rst_c' via the GSR component.
